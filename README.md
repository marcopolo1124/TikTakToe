TicTacToe
=========

A (questionably) playable game of tic tac toe. The rules are simple:
1. Two players (Circle and Cross) play in turns. Circle starts first
2. A prompt will ask for you to move. Enter TL, T, TR, CL, C, CR, BL, B, BR to control. Rows are split into T, C, B for top, center and bottom, whilst the columns are split into L, // , R for left, (neutral), and right. Overlapping moves will cause the turn to restart
3. Try to connect three of your own spaces to win (Horizontal, Vertical and Diagonal.) If there is a winner, the game will stop. If all 9 spaces are filled and there are no winner, the game draws and ends.
